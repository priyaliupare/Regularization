# Regularization
Fitting Models
Regularization is a technique used for tuning the function by adding an additional penalty term in the error function. The additional term controls the excessively fluctuating function such that the coefficients don't take extreme values.


* Examples of regularization
Examples of regularization, included; K-means: Restricting the segments for avoiding redundant groups. Neural networks: Confining the complexity (weights) of a model. Random Forest: Reducing the depth of tree and branches (new features)
